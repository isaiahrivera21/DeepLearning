# ECE 472 - DEEP LEARNING

## Course Description   
> Differentiable directed acyclic graphs covering applications in unsupervised learning, as well as generative and discriminative modeling. Gradient-based methods for optimization (stochastic gradient descent, Nesterov momentum, adam). Fast gradient computation for arbitrary computational graphs (automatic differentiation). Exploding and vanishing gradient problems. Convolutional networks. Arbitrary graphs for regression, classification and ranking. Autoencoders, adversarial networks and variations for unsupervised representation learning, generative modeling and other applications. Focus on applications in computer vision, speech processing and research problems in communication theory.

## Projects 

### Project 1 - BasisExpansion
> Perform linear regression of a noisy sinewave using a set of gaussian basis functions with learned location and scale parameters. Model parameters are learned with stochastic gradient descent. Use of automatic differentiation is required

### Project 2 - Binary Spiral Classification
>  Perform binary classification on the spirals dataset using a multi-layer perceptron. 

### Project 3 - MNIST
> Classify MNIST digits with a convolutional neural network. 

### Project 4 - CIFAR
> Classify CIFAR10. Achieve performance similar to the state of the art. Classify CIFAR100. Achieve a top-5 accuracy of 90%. 

### Project 5 - AG News
> Classify the AG News dataset.

### Project 6 - Basic Decoder Only Transformer
> Implement a MultiHeadAttention class and a TransformerBlock
class. Assume 1-D case only. 

### Project 7 - SIREN
> See SIREN at https://www.vincentsitzmann.com/siren/.
Implement their method for “Image Fitting” on a single image
